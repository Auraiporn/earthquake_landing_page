          "An earthquake can happen anywhere. However, the vast majority of
          earthquakes occur at the boundaries between tectonic plates.
          Continental and oceanic plates may move toward each other, scrape past
          each other, or pull apart as they move slowly across the planet's
          upper mantle. This movement of the plates, and the pressure that is
          built up at the boundaries, can result in earthquakes" (National
          Geografic).

      <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        - Add a map API to display where the earthquakes occur. <br />
        - Add other resources about natural disaster such as checking the
        flooding locations, wildfire, etc.<br />
        -Make an app to be a resource for finding information about natural
        disaster such as adding a search function.<br />
